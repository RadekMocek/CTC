# Go concurrency

## Create gas station simulation

1. Cars arrive at the gas station and wait in the queue for free station
1. Total number of cars and their arrival time is configurable
1. There are 4 types of stations: gas, diesel, LPG, electric
1. Count of stations and their serve time is configurable as interval (e.g. 2â€“5s) and can be different for each type
1. Each station can serve only one car at a time, serving time is chosen randomly from station's interval
1. After the car is served, it goes to the cash register
1. Count of cash registers and their handle time is configurable
1. After the car is handled (random time from register handle time range) by the cash register, it leaves the station
1. Program collects statistics about the time spent in the queue, time spent at the station and time spent at the cash
   register for every car
1. Program prints the aggregate statistics at the end of the simulation

### Sample configuration

```yaml
cars:
  count: 150000
  arrival_time_min: 1ms   # new car arrives every 1-2ms
  arrival_time_max: 2ms
stations:
  gas:
    count: 2
    serve_time_min: 2ms
    serve_time_max: 5ms
  diesel:
    count: 2
    serve_time_min: 3ms
    serve_time_max: 6ms
  lpg:
    count: 1
    serve_time_min: 4ms
    serve_time_max: 7ms
  electric:
    count: 1
    serve_time_min: 5ms
    serve_time_max: 10ms
registers:
   count: 2
   handle_time_min: 1ms
   handle_time_max: 3ms
```

### Statistics output example

```yaml
stations:
  gas:
    total_cars: 50000
    total_time: 7520s
    avg_queue_time: 14s
    max_queue_time: 5s
  diesel:
    total_cars: 40000
    total_time: 6507s
    avg_queue_time: 15s
    max_queue_time: 5s
  lpg:
    total_cars: 30000
    total_time: 9000s
    avg_queue_time: 5s
    max_queue_time: 5s
  electric:
    total_cars: 30000
    total_time: 25055s
    avg_queue_time: 2s
    max_queue_time: 5s
registers:
  total_cars: 150000
  total_time: 170000s
  avg_queue_time: 2s
  max_queue_time: 5s
```
